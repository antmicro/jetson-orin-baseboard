# Board overview

Jetson Orin Baseboard is an open hardware board design supporting NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX and Orin Nano family of SoMs.
The board design files were created in KiCad 8.x.
The board is a versatile development kit which can be easily adopted in order to make it usable in commercial applications for autonomous vehicles, industry, agriculture, medicine or space.
You can find out more about the Jetson Orin Baseboard in this [blog article](https://antmicro.com/blog/2023/05/jetson-orin-baseboard-1-1-with-orin-nano/), or by visiting Antmicro's portals listed below:

## Power

The board can be powered with the following sources:

### 1. DC Connector

Jetson Orin Baseboard can be powered with a stable DC voltage via the on-board locking DC connector ([`J12`](#J12)) with Molex Nano-Fit plug (see the [Power Supply](getting_started.md#power-supply) section for details related to Nano-Fit power harness assembly).
You can use an external DC adapter for powering the board or a battery pack with rechargeable or non-rechargeable batteries, as long as the provided voltage fits within the accepted range (9-20VDC for board revision >= 1.3.0 and up to 15 V on rev. <= 1.1.7).
In board revision >= 1.3.0, the power supply voltage provided to the SoM is switched between `VCC_IN` power rail and 5V power rail provided by the on-board step down DC-DC converter depending on the `MODULE_ID` pin status.
This enables the use of the Jetson Orin NX in "super" mode which requires a minimum power supply voltage of 8V.
If you plan to power the Jetson Orin Baseboard from a battery pack, please note that battery (re-) charging is currently not supported in the design. 
Adjusting the power supply scenario for specific battery types and charging strategy can be implemented via a custom modification of the baseboard PCB design. 

### 2. Power over Ethernet

Jetson Orin Baseboard supports PoE++ Type 1-4 (IEEE 802.3bt) and negotiates Power Delivery (PD) with a maximum power budget of 60W.
The board includes an isolated PoE DC/DC converter.
You can power the board via the Gigabit Ethernet port ([`J6`](#J6)) using a PoE injector or a PoE-capable Ethernet switch.

### 3. USB-C Power Delivery
* USB Power Delivery PD is available on two USB-C ports:
    * USB-C0 ([`J4`](#J4)) general purpose USB port
    * USB-C3 ([`J3`](#J3)) debug console interface port (disabled in the [shared](https://github.com/antmicro/antmicro-jetson-orin-baseboard-tps65988-config) controller configuration)

Those ports are maintained by the on-board USB-C Power Delivery controller (Texas Instruments/[TPS65988](https://www.ti.com/product/TPS65988/part-details/TPS65988DHRSHR)).
This controller needs to be configured in order to make it implement one of the desired power source/sink negotiation scenarios.

:::{note}
The recommended power supply voltage negotiated with the USB-C PD controller for power sink mode is 20VDC (15VDC for board revisions <= 1.3.0).
If you plan to power up the Jetson Orin Baseboard through the USB PD source, make sure it meets [power requirements](getting_started.md#2-power-supply) for stable operation.

## USB-C Power Delivery controller configuration

The on-board USB-C Power Delivery controller (Texas Instruments/[TPS65988](https://www.ti.com/product/TPS65988/part-details/TPS65988DHRSHR)) can be configured for a specific power profile by writing a binary configuration file to an SPI flash.
You can generate your own configuration file with the [TPS6598X-CONFIG](https://www.ti.com/tool/TPS6598X-CONFIG) utility provided by Texas Instruments.
Please refer to the Jetson Orin Baseboard [schematics](https://github.com/antmicro/jetson-orin-baseboard/blob/main/doc/jetson-orin-baseboard-schematic.pdf) to identify the USB port and power supply rail associated with it to generate a valid power profile setting while using the `TPS6598X-CONFIG` tool.
Also please refer to the [TPS65987DDH and TPS65988DH Host Interface Technical Reference Manual](https://www.ti.com/lit/ug/slvubh2b/slvubh2b.pdf) for further details.

There are several ways to write the USB-C PD configuration to the on-board controller:
* Via an external SPI Flash programmer connected to the [`J9`](#J9)
* Via the [antmicro-jetson-orin-baseboard-tps65988-config](https://github.com/antmicro/antmicro-jetson-orin-baseboard-tps65988-config) tool
  * From the Jetson Orin SoM BSP (user space)
  * From the host (PC) via the USB-C ([`J3`](#J3)) debug console interface port (in baseboard revisions >= 1.1.9)

If you happen to have some of the most recent baseboard revision (>= 1.1.9), the easiest method to use is [flashing from the debug console interface port](#tps65988-config-tool-via-the-debug-console-interface-port).

### External SPI Flash programmer
#### 1. Collect the hardware

You will need the following pieces of hardware to proceed with writing the USB-C PD configuration file to the SPI Flash:

* A computer running Linux (the following procedure has been tested with Ubuntu 23 and Debian 11 distributions)
* USB dongle based on FTDI/(FT4232H-56Q) [FTDI4232](https://ftdichip.com/products/ft4232hq/).
  We suggest using Antmicro's open hardware [Debug Toolkit](https://github.com/antmicro/ftdi-toolkit) to simplify the setup (the cable mentioned below connects its J2 straight with Jetson Orin Baseboard's J9)
* 10 Pin Tag-Connect [TC2050-IDC-NL](https://www.tag-connect.com/product/tc2050-idc-nl-10-pin-no-legs-cable-with-ribbon-connector) cable
  This cable should be connected to the signals from FTDI FT4232 according to the following table:

#### 2. Prepare the FT4232 dongle

  *  Set the [Debug Toolkit](https://github.com/antmicro/ftdi-toolkit) Channel A to 3.3V logic with a jumper.
  *  Enable JTAG VCC with a jumper.
  *  Select `SPI/SWD` interface mode for channel A with a jumper.
  *  Connect the 10 Pin Tag-Connect cable to the Debug Toolkit assuming the connection mapping specified in the table above (for Antmicro Debug Toolkit - connect to J2 connector).

#### 3. Prepare the PC for flashing

  * Install the [flashrom](https://github.com/flashrom/flashrom) utility on your host PC.
    On Debian-based distributions you can use a package manager for that.
```
sudo apt install flashrom
```
  * Adjust the size of the TPS6598 binary configuration file (we named it `config.bin`) to match the SPI flash size:
```
truncate -s 1048576 config.bin
```

#### 4. Write the configuration

  * Connect [Tag-Connect Plug-of-Nails](https://www.tag-connect.com/product/tc2050-idc-nl-050) to the [`J9`](#J9) connector on the Jetson Orin Baseboard.
   Hold the plug in place firmly during the flashing process.
   The SPI flash will be powered via the programming cable during the flashing process - you do not have to provide your Jetson Orin Baseboard with power.

### TPS65988-config tool from Jetson Orin user space

The TPS65988-config flashing script can be found in the [antmicro-jetson-orin-baseboard-tps65988-config](https://github.com/antmicro/antmicro-jetson-orin-baseboard-tps65988-config) repository.

#### 1. Prepare hardware

To properly execute this script, boot the Jetson Orin Baseboard, and connect to it via the [debug console](getting_started.md#connect-the-debug-console) or via SSH. 
Since the PD controller is not yet configured at this point, the baseboard has to be powered from either the [`J12`](#J12) or via PoE connected to the [`J6`](#J6).
Internet connection is also suggested.

#### 2. Install dependencies
Log into Jetson Orin module.
Clone the [antmicro-jetson-orin-baseboard-tps65988](https://github.com/antmicro/antmicro-jetson-orin-baseboard-tps65988-config) repository and install the `smbus2` package using `pip`

```
git clone https://github.com/antmicro/antmicro-jetson-orin-baseboard-tps65988-config.git
pip3 install smbus2
cd antmicro-jetson-orin-baseboard-tps65988-config
```

#### 3. Flash the config
Run:

```
python3 TPS65988_flash.py --erase --write JOBrev1_1_6.bin
```

Expected outcome:
```
(...)
Writing 42KB to flash memory...
Write completed 43968 bytes written
The PD Controller has been flashed successfully
Performing cold reset
```

### TPS65988-config tool via the debug console interface port
This option allows for flashing the USB-C Power Delivery controller without SoM or external power.

#### 1. Prepare hardware
* Disconnect power supply from the baseboard
* Remove Jetson module from the baseboard
* Connect a host PC to Jetson Orin Baseboard USB-C Debug Connector ([`J3`](#J3))

#### 2. Install dependencies

On the host PC:

Clone the [antmicro-jetson-orin-baseboard-tps65988-config](https://github.com/antmicro/antmicro-jetson-orin-baseboard-tps65988-config) repository and install the `smbus2` package with `pip`

```
git clone https://github.com/antmicro/antmicro-jetson-orin-baseboard-tps65988-config.git
pip3 install smbus2
cd antmicro-jetson-orin-baseboard-tps65988-config
```

#### 3. Write the configuration
```
python3 TPS65988_flash.py --erase --write ./JOBrev1_1_6.bin --ft230x
```
During the flashing process the [`D3`](#D3) LED should light up.

Expected outcome:
```
(...)
Writing 42KB to flash memory...
Write completed 43968 bytes written
The PD Controller has been flashed successfully
Performing cold reset
Reverting FT230X to UART configuration
```
The [`D3`](#D3) RX LED should turn off indicating end of communication.

## Mechanics

The Jetson Orin Baseboard PCB is 120x60 millimeters (WxL) which translates into 4.72x2.36 inch.
The overall height of the set depends on the cooling module attached.
The base setup with a default cooling module is 37 mm or 1.45 inch tall.
The KiCad PCB design files include mechanical layers with dimensions specified for the fastening holes and notable components.
The board with the Jetson Module, M.2 storage and cooling module weighs 164g (5.78oz).
The mechanical STEP models of the Jetson Orin Baseboard in notable revisions are provided in the [releases](https://github.com/antmicro/jetson-orin-baseboard/releases/) sections available on GitHub.
